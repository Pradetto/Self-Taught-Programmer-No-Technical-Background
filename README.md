# Self-Taught-Programmer-No-Technical-Background

Hi All! I wanted to share all my notes and path I have spent hours of reserach on to future aspiring programmers to hopefully help someone out with guidance and maybe save you a little time on your learning journey. Worse case a good reference to hopefully let you know where to start out.

This will be tailored towards Backend Engineering / Web Development.

I know some courses I took were paid because it provided me with a little structure but please note all the paid courses can be substituted with Youtube and Free Code Camp.

## Where I Started:

### Choosing Language
I started with Python, imo if you aren't sure what area of programming you want to get into it is a safe area to start because it is so universal. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do until 4 months in my journey so don't worry if that is you.

But, if you know what area you want to enter I would select a relevant language. It the grand scheme it doesn't make a difference just pick one and stick with it.

### First Course
1) I started with Code Academy Python Course (It is paid) I thought it was alright it was good at making you practice and getting the fundamentals of programming down.
2) I grinded Codewars problems. I set a goal to do 2-4 a day. They were really hard at first but it helpped solidify the fundamentals and gave good practice to solve problems. Don't worry if you struggle eventually you will overcome it with time Rome wasn't built in a day.

## Data Structures Algorithms

### Math
1) do you need math? No and yes.. Life would be easier if you had the time to learn it all but in my case I was fortunate enough to talk calc back in College/HS. So, I brushed up on Discrete Math and Linear Algebra with Code Academy. I would rate the math course midtier and provided me a little insight on what to expect for DSA. If you have the time I would recommend learning the math to build a strong fundamentals because it would help speed up the learning curve for DSA. Or you can be stubborn like me and I am fine with DSA now just took longer lol. (Again paid)

### DSA
1) Although I only learned Python I opted for a Udemy course that was paid

# Self-Taught-Programmer-No-Technical-Background

Hi All! I wanted to share all my notes and path I have spent hours of research on to future aspiring self-taught programmers to hopefully help someone out with guidance and maybe save you a little time on your learning journey. Worse case this should be a good starting point document to outline what to expect on a journey but ultimately it is up to you to decide what you want to do and learn.

My notes will be shared in this repository, which will be good study material for anyone.

This will be tailored towards Backend Engineering / Web Development.

I know some courses I took were paid because it provided me with a little structure but please note all the paid courses can be substituted with Youtube and Free Code Camp. If this respository gets a lot of traction I will be more than happy to share links to some of these resources if people would be interest in it. Definitely, use the paid resource syllabus's to guide your self-taught learning. I am in no way sponsored nor promoting any course this can all be done through free resources this was just my journey.

## Where I Started:

### Choosing Language
I started with Python, IMO if you aren't sure what area of programming you want to get into it is a safe area to start because it is so universal. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do until 4 months in my journey so don't worry if that is you.

But, if you know what area you want to enter I would select a relevant language. In the grand scheme it doesn't make a difference just pick one and stick with it (don't try to learn multiple languages at once starting out... Literally just pick one and start and don't look back).

### First Course
1) I started with Code Academy Python Course (It is paid) I thought it was alright it was good at making you practice and getting the fundamentals of programming down.
2) I grinded Codewars problems. I set a goal to do 2-4 a day. They were really hard at first but it helpped solidify the fundamentals and gave good practice to solve problems. Don't worry if you struggle eventually you will overcome it with time Rome wasn't built in a day.

### Github/Git/Command Line
Just go to Youtube or Free Code Camp and take a quick course on Github/Git you will be using this a lot to share your projects online. When it is applicable definitely practice using all three it helps a ton!

### Programming Basics
-- Basic --
- Variables
- Conditions
- Chained Conditionals
- Operators
- Control Flow (If/Else)
- Loops and iterables
- Basic Data Structure
- Functions
- Mutable vs. Immutable
- Common Methods
- File IO

### Editor
Install an editor to program on your own system. I chose vscode but you can choose anyone you like.

## Data Structures Algorithms

### Math
Do you need math? No and yes.. Life would be easier if you had the time to learn it all but in my case I was fortunate enough to talk calc back in College/HS. So, I brushed up on Discrete Math and Linear Algebra with Code Academy. I would rate the math course midtier and provided me a little insight on what to expect for DSA (discrete math course was better than linear algebra if you were to do one but it was ehh). If you have the time I would recommend learning the math to build a strong fundamentals because it would help speed up the learning curve for DSA. Or you can be stubborn like me and I am fine with DSA now just took longer lol. (Again paid but I definitely dabbled on Youtube to cover import concepts like Binary Numbers, Hexadecimal and Octal numbers/ probability etc etc)

### DSA
1) Although I only learned Python I opted for a Udemy course that was paid that taught DSA in Javascript. It is called Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms (it is a Zero Too Mastery course). If you are a beginner to DSA I highly recommend it because it also touches on some Software Fundamentals super easy to follow.
2) After DSA I started to leetcode grind and realized that I still didn't know DSA enough so I took another DSA course that was a deeper than the beginner one. This one was in Python called Data Structures and Algorithms: In-Depth using Python. Really good graph and Tree Section. Helped further understanding.
3) Used tons and tons of youtube to also learn the concepts. Neetcode has great leetcode videos
4) Started to grind out Cracking the Coding Interview (Interview Book) and Leetcode probelsm.
- I know it seems like overkill but I wanted to make sure I had a really strong foundation before moving on to other topics.
- Just know if you are like me this was really hard to learn and I felt like quitting multiple times but I stuck with it and it was totally worth it. Just know if you are in a rut or stuck try changing how you are learning the Data Strucutre or Algoirthm i.e. Books vs Videos vs Youtube vs Courses Trail and Error and you will get it I promise.

### My Flashcard Deck
Highly recommend for anyone who is studying for DSA interviews. This is why I was originally creating this post to share it with others. See attached file in repository.

### Leetcode
It is recommended to study leetcode by category. Tons of great resources to recommend what questions to study. I recommend a list developed by a FB egineer that covers every topic an interview should have. https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions

This will help you identify areas you are weak in to study further. Cannot stress enough this is not supposed to be easy but with time you will pick up the patterns. Force yourself to try until you fail then if you can't get it after 20-30 minutes use the hints and then if that fails look up videos of the solution and follow the code step by step.

### Debugger
Underrated but recommend using your debugger in your editor to go step by step in your functions to understand the algorithms / data structures at a deeper level. I use vscode for my editor and the debugger works fine. This really helped if you are stuck on Recursion / Backtracking Algorithms.

## Backend Framework

### HTML/CSS
If you have the fundamentals of programming taking the FCC 12 hours HTML/CSS course will give you everything you need to start developing your own apps and projects. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc

### Django
1) After some reserach it came down to Django vs Flask. I started with Flask because it was easier but then I realized if you took the time to learn Django the whole framework would force you to have a deeper understanding of Web Development. Where in Flask it is easy to overlook things.
2) I took a FCC to learn Django it also taught some Software/ Web Development Fundamental recommend it. Then also paired it with a Udemy course. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0XbHvKxw7Y
4) Start building out your projects. Start with easy stuff, blog posts, to-do apps and your personal website. If you need a personal website I can plan on posting the code for mine on Github.

After you got the basics down, definitely compelte the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website
. Great guided tutorial that covers nearly everything you would need to learn to put in your projects.

### Bootstrap
Since I opted to learn Python over Javascript which is used in frontend web development and I am not pursuing a Full-Stack role. I use a ton of Bootstrap to develop a nice UI on my projects. Definitely learn how to incorporate it in your projects it will save you a ton of time and not confuse you with trying to learn another language just yet.

### APIs
A lot of job descriptions nowadays would like for candidates to have knowledge of APIs. I opted for the Django Rest Framework. You can learn about them on FCC / Youtube.

### Deployment
Now that you have built some of your projects practice deploying them this is a whole new skillset and might require you to rework some of your projects. I used Heroku because it was free and learned it on Youtube.

### Testing
Here is a good beginner article to introduce testing. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/software-testing-for-beginners/ . This alone is not enough but you have to do your own research on what testing you want to learn about. This article should help guide you in the right direction.

### Software Design/Fundamentals
If you took the above Django course on FCC this touched on some of the topics. But here is an additional resource. (ADD LINK)

## SQL

### Postgres
I chose Postgres because it is a popular and what my course was taught in. I took a Udemy course to learn the Postgres SQL. I recommend it again this is paid but can be learned on Youtube or FCC. It is easy to pick up SQL if all above has been completed. 

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/

### Database Design
FCC has a couple good courses on Database Design. 25 hours of fun. This should be easy to learn if all above has been completed.
1) Part I of course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cWkVbC2bNE 
2) Part II of course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxEdaElkQhQ

## Further Python Programming Language Skills
Now that you are getting pretty serious I would expand the horizon of your Python coding skills to intermediate and advance concepts. I bought a book called Fluent Python definitely has some overkill content but highly recommend to use a resource and good referecne to some of the following topics.

Here is a list of things to learn:

-- Intermediate --
- Comprehensiona
- Lambda
- Collections Module
- Map and Filter
- *args and **kwargs
- Inheritance
- Advanced Class
- Behaviour
- PIP
- Environments
- Module Creation
- Async IO

-- Advanced --
- Decorators
- Genrerators
- Context Managers
- Metaclass
- Concurrency
- Parallelism
- Testing
- Packages
- Cython

## Apply to Jobs
After compelting all the above this should be enough to make you employable. Just apply away as soon as you ahve your portfolio, resume and projects in order.

## Another Language or Possibly Pivot Career Paths

### Full-Stack Interests or Frontend?
If you have completed all above and decided backend isn't for you and you have an interest for Full-Stack or Frontend. I would recommend learning Javascript through the Odin Project heard tons of great things about it. Don't think your time was wasted because it wasn't you can still use Django as your backend. Right now if you learn JS I would also recommend React as the front-end so you can pair Django and React. Eventually you probably will pick up Nodejs and MongoDB but just a place to start.

### Data Engineering
No this is not the same as a Data Scientist that will require more math and a different skill set. Data Engineering is the bridge between Web Development and Data Science. Well now that you know a little bit about APIs and Web Develpment although this doesn't directly correlate to Data Engineering it isn't bad to know. But you do know python. If you want to be more engaged in data engineering. Definitely master SQL, learn some more Python Modules like pandas, numpy, matplotlib.. Probabbly pick up Hadoop and Spark to start your journey out in Data Engineering. 


## Final Comments

Again this is your journey! There is no rush enjoy the progamming and don't create abnormal stress on yourself. It took me four months to figure this out. Enjoy learning something new instead of setting time contraints and trying to cram how fast you can learn everything. Trust me I did this for 4 months and the one thing I have learned is just take it one item at a time. And I know you have probably watched videos about people saying the only way to learn is by practicing and you are thinking ya I will. But no really that is the only way practice practice practice. It is really easy to get stuck in the tutorial loop. Lastly, don't get in the trap of trying to find the best resource you will end up wasting a ton of time on this because everyone's opinion is different. Just pick one and stikc with it.

Feel free to disagree with everything I said but hopefully this got the gears turning and you can now make better educated decisions moving forward.

If you would like additional help or have additional questions feel free to reach out to me via LinekdIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-pradetto/. I would be more than happy to help.

If you made it this far! You got this! One day at a time :)

Thank you for reading!

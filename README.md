# Self-Taught-Programmer-No-Technical-Background

Hi All! I wanted to share all my notes and path I have spent hours of reserach on to future aspiring programmers to hopefully help someone out with guidance and maybe save you a little time on your learning journey. Worse case a good reference to hopefully let you know where to start out.

This will be tailored towards Backend Engineering / Web Development.

I know some courses I took were paid because it provided me with a little structure but please note all the paid courses can be substituted with Youtube and Free Code Camp. If this respository gets a lot of traction I will be more than happy to share links to some of these resources if people would be interest in it.

## Where I Started:

### Choosing Language
I started with Python, imo if you aren't sure what area of programming you want to get into it is a safe area to start because it is so universal. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do until 4 months in my journey so don't worry if that is you.

But, if you know what area you want to enter I would select a relevant language. It the grand scheme it doesn't make a difference just pick one and stick with it.

### First Course
1) I started with Code Academy Python Course (It is paid) I thought it was alright it was good at making you practice and getting the fundamentals of programming down.
2) I grinded Codewars problems. I set a goal to do 2-4 a day. They were really hard at first but it helpped solidify the fundamentals and gave good practice to solve problems. Don't worry if you struggle eventually you will overcome it with time Rome wasn't built in a day.

### Github/Git/Command Line
Just go to Youtube or Free Code Camp and take a quick course on Github/Git you will be using this a lot to share your projects online. When it is applicable definitely practice using all three it helps a ton!

## Data Structures Algorithms

### Math
1) do you need math? No and yes.. Life would be easier if you had the time to learn it all but in my case I was fortunate enough to talk calc back in College/HS. So, I brushed up on Discrete Math and Linear Algebra with Code Academy. I would rate the math course midtier and provided me a little insight on what to expect for DSA. If you have the time I would recommend learning the math to build a strong fundamentals because it would help speed up the learning curve for DSA. Or you can be stubborn like me and I am fine with DSA now just took longer lol. (Again paid but I definitely dabbled on Youtube to cover import concepts like Binary Numbers, Hexadecimal and Octal numbers/ probability etc etc)

### DSA
1) Although I only learned Python I opted for a Udemy course that was paid that taught DSA in Javascript. It is called Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms (it is a Zero Too Mastery course). If you are a beginner to DSA I highly recommend it because it also touches on some Software Design Principles.
2) After DSA I started to leetcode grind and realized that I still didn't know DSA enough so I took another DSA course that was a deeper than the beginner one. This one was in Python called Data Structures and Algorithms: In-Depth using Python. Really good graph and Tree Section.
3) Used tons and tons of youtube to also learn the concepts. Neetcode has great leetcode videos
4) Started to grind out Cracking the Coding Interview and Leetcode probelsm.
- I know it seems like overkill but I wanted to make sure I had a really strong foundation before moving on to other topics.

### My Flashcard Deck
Highly recommend for anyone who is studying for DSA interviews. This is why I was originally creating this post to share it with others.

## Backend Framework

### HTML/CSS
1) if you have the fundamentals of programming taking the FCC 12 hours HTML/CSS course will give you everything you need to start developing your own apps and projects. Here is the link:

### Django
1) After some reserach it came down to Django vs Flask. I started with Flask because it was easier but then I realized if you took the time to learn Django the whole framework would force you to have a deeper understanding of everything that goes into Web Development where Flask you would have to choose to add it in.
2) I took a FCC to learn Django it also taught some Software Design Principles recommend it. Then also paired it with a Udemy course.
3) Start building out your projects. Start with easy stuff, blog posts, to-do apps and your personal website. If you need a personal website I can plan on posting the code for mine on Github.

After you got the basics down, definitely compelte the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website
. Great guided tutorial to build out all your projects.

## SQL

### Postgres
